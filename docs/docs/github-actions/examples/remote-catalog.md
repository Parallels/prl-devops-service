# Securely create and share Golden Master images with your team in minutes

## Introduction

One of the key challenges of managing many virtual machines is ensuring that all are running the same software stack. This is especially true when you have a large team of developers, each of whom may have their unique development environment.
There is also the concern of ensuring the software stack is secure and up-to-date. This is where Golden images come in. A Golden Master image is a virtual machine that has been configured with the software stack that you want to use. This image can then be shared with your team, ensuring everyone uses the same software stack.

Let's look at how you can use the Parallels Desktop DevOps Service to create a Golden Master image and share it with your team. We will create an Ubuntu Virtual Machine and install the required software stack. We will then use the Parallels Desktop DevOps Service to make a Golden Master image of the virtual machine and share it with our team using the Parallels Desktop DevOps Service and its [Remote Catalog]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/catalog) capability.

**So lets get started!**

## Creating a local Golden Master image

### Requirements

- [Parallels Desktop for Mac](https://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/){:target="_blank"}
- [Parallels Desktop DevOps Service](https://github.com/Parallels/prl-devops-service){:target="_blank"}

{% include notification.html message="You can try it for free before purchasing by clicking this [link](https://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/trial/){:target=\"_blank\"} and downloading our trial version" status="is-success" icon="comments-dollar" %}


{% assign installationContent = site.pages | where:"url", "/docs/getting-started/installation/" | first %}

{{ installationContent.content }}


### Install Parallels Desktop for Mac

After installing the DevOps service, we can use it to install **Parallels Desktop for Mac** by running this command:

```sh
prldevops install parallels-desktop
```

This will download and install the latest version of **Parallels Desktop for Mac** and install it on your system.

### Create a Virtual Machine

We have installed the virtualization software and can now create a virtual machine. For this example, we will create a virtual machine of Ubuntu 22.04 Server.

#### Download the ISO for your architecture

You can download the ISO from the [Ubuntu website](https://ubuntu.com/download/server) or use the links below:

{% include inner-tabs.html content='download_ubuntu_tab' %}

#### Install Ubuntu

After downloading the ISO, you can create a new virtual machine using either **Parallels Desktop Control Center** or the **Command Line Interface**.

{% include inner-tabs.html content="create_vm_tab" %}

#### Installing Parallels Tools in the Virtual Machine

To enable certain features in this example, the Parallels Tools must be installed. You can do this by following the instructions that appear on the screen. Unfortunately, until the tools are installed, you won't be able to use the copy and paste function. In order to proceed, please go to the machine, login with the user you created, and enter the following commands:

Let's start by unmounting any currently mounted cdroms and creating a new mount point for the `cdrom0` device.
```sh
for dev in /dev/sr0 /dev/cdrom /dev/dvd; do sudo eject $dev; done 2>/dev/null
sudo mkdir /media/cdrom0
```

Now lets add the `Parallels Desktop Tools` iso using the ui

<div class="flex flex-center">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/img/examples/install_tools_step03.gif" alt="Install Parallels Tools step 3"/>
</div>

To install the tools, run the command given below: 

```sh
sudo mount -o exec /dev/sr0 /media/cdrom0
sudo /media/cdrom0/install
reboot
```

You should have **Parallels Desktop Tools** installed and running. For more information, follow the [official documentation](https://kb.parallels.com/129740){:target="_blank"}

#### Customize the Golden Image (Optional)

For our example we will be installing some development tools stack, **this is not mandatory and it serves only as an example**.  
You can entirely skip this step if you want to just quickly test the service.

Our software stack will include:

- Docker
- Node.js
- Python
- Dotnet SDK

To start, we need to access the machine through the terminal using the command line client. Use the following command:

```sh
prlctl enter "test-vm"
```

Once inside, we can proceed with installing the necessary software stack by running the following commands: 

```sh
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install -y docker.io nodejs npm python3 git dotnet-sdk-8.0
```

After the installation is complete, you will have a virtual machine with the required software stack installed, and it will be ready for use.

## Configuring and Running our DevOps Remote Catalog

The DevOps Remote Catalog is a service designed to facilitate the sharing of VMs or Golden Master Images in your organization, if you want to know more on how it works you can check the [official documentation]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/catalog/overview/){:target="_blank"}

{% include notification.html message="For this example, we will set up **Parallels Desktop DevOps Remote Catalog** service as a locally running daemon. You can deploy it as a docker container in the cloud or as a daemon service in any remote macOS." status="is-info" %}

### Configuring the DevOps Remote Catalog

To set up the service, we will need to create or edit a [configuration file]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/getting-started/configuration/){:target="_blank"}. 

1. Run the command below to create the config file:  
   *If you have previously created a configuration file, you can skip this step*

    ```powershell
    touch config.yml
    ```

3. Open the file
4. 
    ```powershell
    open -a TextEdit /usr/local/bin/config.yaml
    ```

5.  Add the following content:

    ```yaml
    environment:
      api_port: 80
      mode: catalog
    ```

This will configure the service to run in catalog mode and listen on port 80 with all the default settings. However, this setup is only suitable for quick testing. For production use, we need to implement additional security measures to ensure a more secure deployment. You can find more information about security options in the [official documentation]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/getting-started/harden-security/){:target="_blank"}

### Security

The service will run with default values, these are just fine for demos and to quickly get the service running but for production use, you will need to secure the service. You can find more information about how to secure the service in the [official documentation]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/getting-started/harden-security/){:target="_blank"}

### Starting the service

To initiate the service, all you need to do is execute the command given below:

```powershell
prldevops
```

If you have started the service as a daemon, you can check the status of the service by running the command below:

```powershell
sudo launchctl kickstart -k system/com.parallels.devops-service
```

## Changing the Root password

Typically, the service is initiated with a randomly generated root password. However, in order to access the service's REST API, you will need to update this password. To do so, we provide a simple command line. For instance, we will set the password as `VeryStr0ngP@ssw0rd`, but you may choose any password you prefer.

```prldevops
prldevops update-root-password --password=VeryStr0ngP@ssw0rd
```

## Pushing the Golden Master Image to the Remote Catalog

We now have our` DevOps Remote Catalog` service up and running, which means we can proceed to push the Golden Master image to the service. But before we start, we need to take care of a few requirements. 
The `DevOps Remote Catalog` works by storing only the metadata of the Golden Master image. This implies that the actual image will be stored in a remote location. In this example, we will be using an **S3 bucket** to store the image. However, you can use any other compatible storage service like **Azure Blob Storage** or **jfrog artifactory**. Most of these providers offer a free tier that you can use to test this feature. For more information about the architecture, you can refer to this link [here]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/catalog/overview/#architecture){:target="_blank"}.

### Creating the PDFile

We have designed an easy way to automate the `push` and `pull` process of virtual machines (VMs) using a reusable file called pdfile. This file contains essential information required to `push` and `pull` VMs from our catalog. It is similar to a dockerfile but specific for VMs. You can find more information about the pdfile in the [official documentation]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/catalog/pdfile/){:target="_blank"}  

In this example we will be using the `Local Storage` provider, this provider is used to store the VMs in the local machine, this is useful for testing purposes.

Before we can push the Golden Master image to the local storage, we need to create a folder that will contain our VM image. This folder will be used as the `CATALOG_PATH` in the pdfile. For now we will be creating a folder in our user space called `prldevops-catalog-manifests`

```powershell
mkdir ~/prldevops-catalog-manifests
```

To create a pdfile, you need to create a pdfile anywhere in your system, for example:

```powershell
touch ~/ubuntu-builder.pdfile
open -a TextEdit ~/ubuntu-builder.pdfile
```

 include the following content:

```pdfile
# This is the catalog host we want to push the image to
TO localhost
# We are using the localhost and this is insecure so we can add the insecure flag
INSECURE true

# We authenticate this using the root user and the password we set before
AUTHENTICATE USERNAME root
AUTHENTICATE PASSWORD VeryStr0ngP@ssw0rd

# We will be using the local storage provider to store the VM
PROVIDER NAME local-storage
PROVIDER catalog_path /Users/<user>/prldevops-catalog-manifests

# The path to the VM image we want to push
LOCAL_PATH </path/to/the/test-vm.pvm>

# Description of the VM, this is optional and just adds a description to the catalog entry
DESCRIPTION Build Machine

# The tags of the VM, this is optional and just adds tags to the catalog entry that will
# help to filter the catalog entries
TAG ubuntu, build-machine, arm64, docker, python, nodejs

# The catalog id of the image we want to push
CATALOG_ID ubuntu-22-04-builder

# The version of the image we want to push
VERSION v1

# The architecture of the image we want to push, this is optional and if omitted the
# architecture will be set to the architecture of the VM
ARCHITECTURE arm64
```

Where:

- `<user>`: will be the user name for your system
- `</path/to/the/test-vm.pvm>`: is the path to the VM image you want to push to the catalog


This will push the VM from the *LOCAL_PATH* to the localhost *remote catalog* with everyone having access to it. However, we can restrict access to specific claims and roles for each catalog entry. To achieve this, you can add the `ROLE` and/or `CLAIM` into the pdfile and using our RBAC system, you can restrict access to the catalog entry.  

You can read more about the RBAC and how to set it up in the [official documentation]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/security/rbac/){:target="_blank"}

#### Pushing the Golden Master Image

To push the VM image to the catalog, you can run the following command:

```prldevops
prldevops push ~/ubuntu-builder.pdfile
```

{% include notification.html message="This process duration may vary depending on your VM size and internet speed." status="is-warning" %}

### Listing the Catalog

Now that we pushed the Golden Master image to the catalog, we can list the catalog entries by running the following command:

```prldevops
prldevops catalog list
```

this should return a list of all the catalog entries that are available in the catalog.for example:

<div class="flex flex-center">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/img/examples/catalog_list.png" alt="Catalog List"/>
</div>

### Pulling the Golden Master Image

Now that we have the Golden Master image in the catalog, we can allow our team to pull it and use it to create new virtual machines.

This of course is going to use the local storage provider as an example but you can use any other provider that you have configured in the service.

To pull the image that we just pushed, we need to create a new pdfile that will contain the information required to pull the image.

To create a pull pdfile, you need to create a pdfile anywhere in your system, for example:

```powershell
touch ~/pull-ubuntu-builder.pdfile
open -a TextEdit ~/pull-ubuntu-builder.pdfile
```

Include the following content:

```pdfile
# This is the catalog host we want to pull the image from
FROM localhost
# We are using the localhost and this is insecure so we can add the insecure flag
INSECURE true

# This is the catalog id of the image we want to pull
CATALOG_ID ubuntu-22-04-builder
# The version of the image we want to pull
VERSION v1
# The architecture of the image we want to pull
ARCHITECTURE arm64

# The name of the machine that will be created
MACHINE_NAME build-machine

# We can set the ownership of the machine to a specific user, this is not mandatory and
# if omitted the machine will be owned by the user that is pulling the image
OWNER cjlapao
# The destination where the machine will be stored, this is not mandatory and if omitted
# if omitted the machine will be stored in the default location of the parallels desktop
DESTINATION /Users/<user>/Parallels

# We can set the machine to start after the pull is complete, this is not mandatory and if omitted
# the machine will not start after the pull is complete
START_AFTER_PULL false
```

Where:

- `<user>`: will be the user name for your system

To pull the image from the catalog, the user will need to authenticate with the service by passing either the `--username` and `--password` flags or by using the `--api-key` flag with a valid key. If the user has the required claims to access the image, the service will then pull the image from the remote storage and create a new virtual machine with the same software stack as the Golden Master image. Otherwise, it will return a **not found** error.

```prldevops
prldevops pull ~/pull-ubuntu-builder.pdfile --username=root --password=VeryStr0ngP@ssw0rd
```

After the image is pulled, the user will have a new virtual machine with the same software stack as the Golden Master image, ready to be used. 

{% include notification.html message="It is important to note that this process may take some time, depending on the size of the virtual machine and the user's internet connection." status="is-warning" %}

## Conclusion

In this example, we have demonstrated how the Parallels Desktop DevOps Service can be used to create a Golden Master image. This image can then be shared with your team through the Parallels Desktop DevOps Service and its Remote Catalog feature. 

We have also highlighted how the Parallels Desktop DevOps Service can be utilized to retrieve the Golden Master image from the catalog and generate a new virtual machine with the same software stack as the Golden Master image.

This streamlined approach facilitates the secure sharing of Golden Master images with your team, ensuring that everyone has access to the same software stack.
