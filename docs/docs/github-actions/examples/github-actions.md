# Use Github Actions to automate your CI/CD pipeline

## Introduction

One of the most commonly used CI/CD tools is Github Actions. It is a powerful automation tool that allows you to build, test, and deploy your code from your Github repository. By default, you get access to 2000 free minutes per month for your Github Actions on Ubuntu machines. However, this number is reduced to 1000 minutes for Windows and 200 minutes for macOS machines. While the 2000 minutes are sufficient for most projects, larger teams might require more.

Fortunately, GitHub allows you to run your own self-hosted runners, which enables you to run your CI/CD pipeline on your own infrastructure. This is particularly useful if you have specific requirements that are not supported by the default Github Actions runners or if you have security concerns. Furthermore, you might have a large number of jobs that you need to run, and the free minutes are not enough.

In this guide, we will show you how to use our Parallels Desktop GitHub Action to set up your self-hosted runner on your Mac, Windows, or Linux Vms. This will enable you to run your CI/CD pipeline without any limitations and with no extra costs, all while maintaining the same level of security and isolation as the default Github Actions runners.

If you're interested in learning more about self-hosted runners, then you can read more about them on the [Github documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners){:target=\"_blank\"}.

**Let's get started!**

## Requirements

- [Parallels Desktop for Mac](https://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/){:target=\"_blank\"}
- [Parallels Desktop DevOps Service](https://github.com/Parallels/prl-devops-service){:target=\"_blank\"}
- [GitHub account and repository](https://github.com){:target=\"_blank\"}

{% include notification.html message="You can try **Parallels Desktop** for free before purchasing by clicking this [link](https://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/trial/){:target=\"_blank\"} and downloading our trial version" status="is-success" icon="comments-dollar" %}

On this guide, we will show you how to set up one of our demo repositories. They are free and open to use, so you can copy the code or take inspiration for your own projects.

{% assign installationContent = site.pages | where:"url", "/docs/getting-started/installation/" | first %}

{{ installationContent.content }}


### Install Parallels Desktop for Mac

After installing the DevOps service, we can use it to install **Parallels Desktop for Mac** by running this command:

```sh
prldevops install parallels-desktop
```

This will download and install the latest version of **Parallels Desktop for Mac** and install it on your system.

## Step 2: Create a Builder Virtual Machine

To run our Actions, we need to create a builder virtual machine. This virtual machine will be used to execute the jobs that are defined in our Github Actions workflow. We have two options for creating the virtual machine - we can either use a pre-built virtual machine that we have created earlier, or create one from scratch.

Additionally, you will need to select the operating system (OS) that you want to use for your runner. The available options are Windows, macOS, and Linux.

You do not need to configure the virtual machine in any special way. You can use the default settings provided by Parallels Desktop. We will be adding the runners during the pipeline setup using a script.

For this example, we have created three virtual machines - one for each OS.

- Windows 11 ARM using the Parallels Desktop Wizard
- macOS Sonoma
- Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS

## Step 3: Create a GitHub Personal Access Token

Each runner needs to be registered with Github, and it is registered to each individual user or organization. To do this, we need to create a Personal Access Token.

1. Go to your Github account settings
2. Click on Developer settings
3. Select Personal access tokens
4. Select Tokens (classic) and click on Generate new token
5. Add a name for your token in `note`
6. Select the `repo` scope
7. Select the `workflow` scope
8. Select the `admin:org` scope
9. Click on Generate token
10. Copy the token and save it in a safe place

## Step 3.1 (Optional): Creating a Generic Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS Virtual Machine Builder

In this example, we decided to be self-sufficient and not rely on any publicly available runners. To achieve this, we created a generic Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS virtual machine and installed the action runner on it. We then registered the runner with Github and will be using it as our self-hosted runner to set up our Github Actions.

It's worth noting that while this approach is optional, you can use any of the publicly available runners. But we wanted to demonstrate how to create and use your own runner.

### Create a new Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS Virtual Machine

1. Download the Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS ISO file from the [Ubuntu website](https://ubuntu.com/download/server){:target=\"_blank\"}
2. Open Parallels Desktop
3. Click on the "+" button on the top left corner
4. Select "Install Windows or another OS from a DVD or image file"
5. Click on "Locate Manually" and select the Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS ISO file
6. Follow the installation steps

### Install Parallel Tools on the Virtual Machine

Because this will be a command line only virtual machine, we need to install the Parallel Tools manually. To do this, we need to mount the Parallel Tools ISO file and run the installation script.

1. Open the virtual machine configuration
2. Click on the "Hardware" tab
3. Click on "CD/DVD 1"
4. Select "Choose an image file"
5. Select the Parallel Tools ISO image from location Application > Parallels Desktop.app > Contents > Resources > Tools > prl-tools-lin-arm.iso
6. Run the following commands on the terminal

```bash
for dev in /dev/sr0 /dev/cdrom /dev/dvd; do sudo eject $dev; done 2>/dev/null
sudo mkdir -p /media/cdrom0
sudo mount -o exec /dev/sr0 /media/cdrom0
cd /media/cdrom0
sudo ./install
```

and flow the installation steps.  

You can also see a more detailed guide on how to install Parallel Tools [here](https://kb.parallels.com/en/129740){:target=\"_blank\"}.

### Install the Github Actions Runner

The installation process of the GitHub Actions Runner on the virtual machine can be facilitated by some scripts available on our [Github repository](https://github.com/Parallels/prlctl-scripts/tree/main/github/actions-runner){:target=\"_blank\"}

To install the runner, you can run the following commands on the terminal:

```powershell
curl -o /home/install-runner.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Parallels/prlctl-scripts/main/github/actions-runner/linux/install-runner.sh
curl -o /home/configure-runner.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Parallels/prlctl-scripts/main/github/actions-runner/linux/configure-runner.sh
curl -o /home/remove-runner.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Parallels/prlctl-scripts/main/github/actions-runner/linux/remove-runner.sh
chmod +x /home/install-runner.sh
chmod +x /home/configure-runner.sh
chmod +x /home/remove-runner.sh
/home/install-runner.sh -u $yourUsername -p /home
/home/configure-runner.sh -u $yourUsername -p /home/action-runner -o $yourOrganization -t $yourGithubPAT -n ubuntu_builder -l ubuntu_builder
```

Where:
- `$yourUsername` is your username used to login to the virtual machine
- `$yourOrganization>` is your Github organization or your Github username
- `$yourGithubPAT>` is your Github Personal Access Token

### Check the Runner is registered and running

Once you have run the script, you can verify if your runner has been registered and is running by following these steps:
1. Go to your Github repository.
2. Click on the 'Settings' tab.
3. Select 'Actions' from the left-hand menu.
4. Click on 'Runners'.
5. Your runner should be listed there.

For example:

![Github Runner]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/img/examples/locally-build-runner-running.png)

We should also ensure that our 'Default' runner group is configured to utilize all repositories, including public ones.

1. Go to your repository on Github
2. Click on `Settings`
3. Click on `Actions`
4. Click on `Runner groups`
5. Click on `Default`
6. Select `All repositories` on the `Repository access` dropdown
7. Tick the `Allow public repositories` checkbox
8. Select `All workflows` on the `Workflow access` dropdown

![Github Runner]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/img/examples/locally-build-default-group.png)

## Step 4: Creating our Github Actions Workflow

Now that we have our builder virtual machine and our personal access token, we can create our Github Actions workflow. On this example we will be using a MAUI sample project from [https://github.com/dotnet/maui-samples](https://github.com/dotnet/maui-samples){:target=\"_blank\"} and create a pipeline that will build the project.

We selected the Weather Sample Application called WeatherTwentyOne, you can find the repository [here](https://github.com/dotnet/maui-samples/tree/main/8.0/Apps/WeatherTwentyOne/src){:target=\"_blank\"}.

You can also find our repository with the Github Actions workflow [here](https://github.com/Locally-build/weather_twenty_one_maui){:target=\"_blank\"}.

### Create a new Github Actions Workflow

To create a new Github Actions workflow, you need to make a new file in your repository within the `.github/workflows` directory. You can pick any name for the file, but it must have the `.yml` or `.yaml` extension.

For instance, let's create an iOS workflow. We'll name our file `build_ios.yml`. In this example, we will add segments to the file and explain what each part does.

#### Secrets

To ensure security most of the services running here will use some sort of authentication and because the workflow is public we need to store the secrets in the Github repository and then retrieve them during run. To do this we will be using Github Secrets, these are encrypted variables that can be used in the workflow.

To add a secret to your repository, you need to:

1. Go to your Organization or Repository on Github
2. Click on `Settings`
3. Click on `Secrets and variables`
4. Click on `Actions`
5. Click on `New organization secret`
6. Fill in the name and the value of the secret, need to be on the format `YOUR_SECRET_NAME`
7. Fill in the value
8. Click on `Add secret`

After this the secret will be available to be used on the workflow as `{% raw %}${{ secrets.YOUR_SECRET_NAME }}{% endraw %}`

![Github Runner]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/img/examples/locally-build-secrets.png)

#### Header of the workflow

This section defines what if the name of the workflow, when it should run and on which branches. we also define some environment variables that we will be using on the workflow. in this example this workflow can be triggered by a workflow call or manually by a workflow dispatch.

```yaml
name: Build iOS App

on:
  workflow_call:
  workflow_dispatch:

env:
    DOTNETVERSION: 8.0.204    
```

#### Job create-runner

The first job we will be creating is the one that will tell devops to clone the created VM and install the runner on it. This job will be running on the `ubuntu_builder` runner that we created before.

```yaml
# this will be the jobs array that will contain all of our jobs
jobs:
  create_runner:
    # This will be the name of the job
    name: Deploy Self Hosted Runner
    # This job will be running on the ubuntu_builder runner self hosted runner
    runs-on: 
    - self-hosted
    - ubuntu_builder
    # This will be the steps that will be executed on this job
    steps:
        # First we will be cloning the generic VM that we created before, in this case we will be cloning
        # a macOs Sonoma VM using our devops service, you can check the documentation on how to do this
        # in the official repository of the GitHub action 
        - name: Clone VM
          id: clone
          uses: parallels/parallels-desktop-github-action@v1
          with:
            operation: 'clone'
            # The username to access the devops service
            username: {% raw %}${{ secrets.PARALLELS_USERNAME }}{% endraw %}
            # The password to access the devops service
            password: {% raw %}${{ secrets.PARALLELS_PASSWORD }}{% endraw %}
            # Set this to true if you are using a self signed certificate
            insecure: true
            # the host for the devops service
            host_url: example.com:8080
            # The name for the VM that we will be cloning
            base_vm: macOS_action_runner_builder
            # If we should start the VM after cloning
            start_after_op: true
        # This step we will be setting up the runner on the VM that we cloned
        - name: Configure Github Runner
          id: configure  
          uses: parallels/parallels-desktop-github-action@v1
          with:
            # How many retries we should do if the operation fails on each execution
            max_attempts: 5
            # What will be the timeout after each failed attempt and before the next one
            timeout_seconds: 2

### Job build-ios

This will be the job that will be building the iOS project, we will be using the runner that we created before to run this job. This can be different from project to project and this is just a over simplified version and should only be used as an example

```yaml
  buildiOS:
    name: Build iOS App
    needs: create_runner
    runs-on: 
        - self-hosted
        - macOS
        - {% raw %} ${{ github.run_id }}_builder{% endraw %}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

        run: |
          # create variables
          CERTIFICATE_PATH=$RUNNER_TEMP/build_certificate.p12
          PP_PATH=$RUNNER_TEMP/build_pp.mobileprovision
          KEYCHAIN_PATH=$RUNNER_TEMP/app-signing.keychain-db

          # import certificate and provisioning profile from secrets
          echo -n "$BUILD_CERTIFICATE_BASE64" | base64 --decode --output $CERTIFICATE_PATH
          echo -n "$BUILD_PROVISION_PROFILE_BASE64" | base64 --decode --output $PP_PATH

          # create temporary keychain
          security create-keychain -p "$KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD" $KEYCHAIN_PATH
          security set-keychain-settings -lut 21600 $KEYCHAIN_PATH

```

#### Job cleanup

This will be a job where we will be cleaning the VM that we created before, this will be running on the `ubuntu_builder` runner that we created before. we also add the `if: always()` as we want this to be run even if the pipelines fail allowing it to at least always try to clean up the resources.

```yaml
  # This will be the id of the job
  clean_runner:
    # This will be an important step as it will allow the pipeline to always run this job
    # even if anything else fails, this allows for a better cleanup process
    if: always()
    # this will tell the job to run on last after both of the other jobs have finished
    needs: [buildiOS, create_runner]
    # This will be the name of the job
    name: Clean Runner
    # This job will be running on the ubuntu_builder runner self hosted runner
    runs-on: 
    - self-hosted
    - ubuntu_builder
    steps:
          # This job will be removing the runner that we created before from the GitHub
        - name: Remove Github Runner
          id: configure  
          uses: parallels/parallels-desktop-github-action@v1
          with:
            operation: 'run'
            username: {% raw %}${{ secrets.PARALLELS_USERNAME }}{% endraw %}
            password: {% raw %}${{ secrets.PARALLELS_PASSWORD }}{% endraw %}
            host_url: example.com:8080
            insecure: true
            machine_name: {% raw %}${{ needs.create_runner.outputs.vm_id }}{% endraw %}
            run: |
                {% raw %}/Users/remove-runner.sh -u parallels -p /Users/action-runner -o Locally-build -t ${{ secrets.GH_PAT }}{% endraw %}
        # This will be removing the VM that we created before
        - name: Remove VM
          # We will also set the if: always() to ensure that this job will always run and the machine is removed
          # even if it fails to remove the runner
          if: always()
          id: remove
          uses: parallels/parallels-desktop-github-action@v1
          with:
            operation: 'delete'
            username: {% raw %} ${{ secrets.PARALLELS_USERNAME }}{% endraw %}
            password: {% raw %} ${{ secrets.PARALLELS_PASSWORD }}{% endraw %}
            insecure: true
            host_url: example.com:8080
            machine_name: {% raw %} ${{ needs.create_runner.outputs.vm_id }}{% endraw %}
```

### Conclusion

After you have gathered all the necessary files in one place, you can commit them to your repository and watch the workflow execute on your repository. To ensure everything is functioning as intended, you may examine the workflow logs.

It is worth noting that all of these steps will be completed using our Parallels Desktop DevOps Service and Virtual Machines. This allows you to run your CI/CD pipeline on your own infrastructure without incurring any additional expenses, while still maintaining the same level of security and isolation as the default Github Actions runners.
