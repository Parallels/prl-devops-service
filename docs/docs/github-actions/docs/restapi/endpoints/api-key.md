# API Keys

API keys are used to authenticate requests to the Parallels Desktop DevOps Service. They are used to identify the calling application and to control access to the API. Each API key is associated with a set of permissions that define what the key can do. While this is also used to authenticate the requests, it differs from the token-based authentication system used to authenticate the users, it is less granular and is normally used for service to service authentication.
