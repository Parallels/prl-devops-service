The DevOps Service can be configured in various ways, such as using `environment variables`, `command line flags`, or a `configuration file`. The order used to determine the configuration is as follows:

1. Environment Variables
2. Command Line Flags
3. Configuration File

## Configuration File

Using the configuration file is the most flexible way to configure the DevOps Service. It allows you to configure the service in a single file and share it with your team or other instances. Additionally, it allows for a shortened command line when starting the service.

You can create a configuration file either in the current binary folder or anywhere in your system. If you have created it in the current binary folder, the service will look for it and use it as the configuration file. Otherwise, you can specify the path to the configuration file using the `--config` flag.

If you have a configuration file in the current binary folder but pass the `--config` flag, the service will use the configuration file specified in the flag, allowing you to effectively have multiple configurations.

Please find below a simple example of a configuration file, which is a `yaml` object:

```yaml
environment:
  api_port: 5570
  log_level: DEBUG
```

The root object of the configuration file is the environment object, which contains all the environment variables that the service will use. The service will look for the environment object and use the values inside it. Below is a list of all the environment variables that the service will use. These will be the same as the command line flags.

### System

| Flag | Description | Default Value |
| ---- | ----------- | ------------- |
| MODE | This can be either `api` or `orchestrator`, and specifies the mode that the service will run in | api |
| ROOT_PASSWORD | The root password that will be used to update the root password of the virtual machine | |
| DATABASE_FOLDER_ENV_VAR | The folder where the database will be stored | /User/Folder/.prl-devops-service |

| SYSTEM_RESERVED_CPU | The number of cpu cores that will be reserved for the system and not used for Orchestrator | 1 |
| SYSTEM_RESERVED_MEMORY | The amount of memory that will be reserved for the system and not used for Orchestrator in Mb's | 2048 |

| JWT_PRIVATE_KEY | The private key that will be used to sign the jwt tokens. This is only required if you are using `RS256`, `RS384` or `RS512` | |
| JWT_HMACS_SECRET | The secret that will be used to sign the jwt tokens. This is only required if you are using `HS256`, `HS384` or `HS512`. Defaults to random |
| JWT_DURATION | The duration that the jwt token will be valid for. You can use the following format, for example, 5 minutes would be `5m` or 1 hour would be `1h` | 15m |
