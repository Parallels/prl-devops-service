This is the Parallels Desktop DevOps Service, a service that will allow you to
manage and orchestrate multiple Parallels Desktop hosts and virtual machines.
It will allow you to create, start, stop and delete virtual machines and will
also allow you to manage the hosts that are running the virtual machines.

If you want to schedule a demo, please schedule a meeting with out Solutions
Architect [here](https://outlook.office.com/bookwithme/user/d6b4c940ec9d44079ed872ba1fcaaf68@alludo.com/meetingtype/you-CpOV8UyS0sFl9KjSWw2?anonymous&ep=mlink){:target=\"_blank\"}.

## Licensing

You can use the service for free with up to **10 users**, without needing any
Parallels Desktop Business license. However, if you want to continue using the
service beyond 10 users, you will need to purchase a Parallels Desktop Business
license. The good news is that no extra license is required for this service
once you have purchased the Parallels Desktop Business license.
