# Whats New

### Added

- Added the machine id to the output of a pull request in the catalog
- Added the ability do do a catalog pull request without the need to specify the
  local machine path, this will be taken from the user configuration in PD
- Added a spinner to the long running commands for pull and push to notify the
  user that the command is still running
- Added a new endpoint to easily clone a virtual machine `/api/v1/machines/{id}/clone`
- Added the ability to **enable** and **disable** a host from the orchestrator
- Added the ability to configure the API **CORS policies** by passing environment variables

### Fixed

- Fixed an typo in the docker-compose file that would not allow the root password
  to be updated
- Fixed an issue in the pull from the catalog where if there was an error the
  system would crash
- Fixed an issue where the provider would not take into account the host with a
  schema present
- Fixed a bug where the system would crash with a waiting group being negative
- Fixed a bug where queries could get stuck while saving to the database
- Fixed an issue where some credentials would be left behind in temporary files
- Further security fixes to the codebase

### Changed

- Packer Templates and Vagrant box endpoints are now disabled by default due to security
  concerns on remote execution of code, you can enable them by setting the environment
  variable `ENABLE_PACKER_PLUGIN` and `ENABLE_VAGRANT_PLUGIN` to `true`
