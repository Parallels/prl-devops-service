# Whats New

### Added

- Added caching mechanism for  local vms, this allows a better management of the
  local vms and reduces the amount of queries to the database, it does have the side
  effect of not showing the vms in real time, but it will show them by default
  every 30s you can change this by setting the environment variable `PARALLELS_DESKTOP_REFRESH_INTERVAL`
- Added a new endpoint to update a host in a orchestrator `[PUT] /api/v1/orchestrator/hosts/{id}`
- Added a backup system for the database, this will backup the database every 2h
  and will keep the last 10 backups by default, this can be changed by setting the
  environment variable `DATABASE_NUMBER_BACKUP_FILES` to the number of
  backups you want to keep and `DATABASE_BACKUP_INTERVAL_MINUTES` to the interval
  you want to backup the database
- Moved the memory database to be saved to a file every 5 minutes, this will allow
  for a better management of the memory database and will allow for a better
  recovery in case of a crash, it will also save on exit or on crash, you can change
  the interval by setting the environment variable `DATABASE_SAVE_INTERVAL_MINUTES`
- Added K6 scripts to perform load tests on the API
- Added a favicon to the documentation

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where we were trying to get the virtual machines for other users
  when not being a super admin
- Fixed some memory leaks in the orchestrator
- Fixed some other small issues
- Fixed some issues that would report a missing vm immediately after
  creating it

### Changed

- Moved database saving process to a 5 minutes setting to avoid overloading the
  database with too many requests
- Changed the way the orchestrator was checking for VMs status changes to avoid
  overloading the database
- Moved all the old commands to the new exec with context to enable timeouts
- Added a 30 seconds timeout when checking the status of the local vms
