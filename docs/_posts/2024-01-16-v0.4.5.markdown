# Whats New

### Added

- added the ability to have a config file for the apiclient, this will help
  users to configure the api with more ease and also will allow them to share
  that same configuration. It will either look for a config file in the current
  directory with the following rules, `config.json`, `config.yaml`, `config.yml`
  you can also add the `.local` before the extension to make it a local config
  you can also specify the path to the config file using the `--config` flag

### Fixed

- fixed a bug where if the JWT token was invalid or empty the client would reset
  the connection without a proper error handling
- fixed a bug if the user would setup the current instance to also be part of the
  orchestrator and the API key would change, then the orchestrator would not be
  able to authenticate

### Changed

- The system will now use the config class to read all of the configuration, this
  will allow us to have a more consistent way of reading the configuration and where
  to search for those values, this allows for example for a parameter to be set in
  either a environment variable, a config file or a command line flag, the order
  of precedence is the following, command line flag, environment variable, config
  file
- updated documentation to reflect the changes in the configuration
